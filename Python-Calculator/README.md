Operations Functions:

The project defines functions for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Additional mathematical functions are included: square, cube, square root, and exponentiation using Euler's number (math.e).
Operations Dictionary:

A dictionary is created to map operator symbols (e.g., "+", "-", "*", "/") to their corresponding functions, making it easy to look up and call the appropriate function based on user input.
Calculator Logic:

The my_calculator function starts the calculator, displaying a logo and prompting the user to input the first number.
It then lists available operations and prompts the user to choose one.
The user is prompted to enter a second number, and the chosen operation is performed using the two numbers.
The result of the operation is displayed, and the user is asked if they want to continue using the result for further calculations or start a new calculation.
Continuous Calculations:

The calculator supports continuous calculations. If the user opts to continue (by typing 'y'), the result of the previous operation is used as the first number for the next operation.
If the user chooses to start a new calculation (by typing 'n'), the screen is cleared, and the calculator restarts, ready for new inputs.
Error Handling:

The program checks if the entered operation is valid. If not, it prompts the user to restart the calculator.
A simple user input validation ensures the user can continue or start a new calculation by entering 'y' or 'n'.
This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, including function definitions, dictionaries, user input handling, loops, and recursion. It offers a simple but interactive way for users to perform and chain multiple mathematical operations in a single session.
